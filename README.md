#Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction Using  Artificial Neural Networks

Overview

This project employs a sophisticated Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture to address the critical challenge of predicting customer churn. Customer churn, defined as the cessation of customer engagement with a business, represents a significant concern for organizations seeking to sustain competitive advantage. By accurately forecasting churn, this work provides actionable insights to enhance customer retention strategies and optimize service delivery.

Features

State-of-the-Art ANN Model: Utilizes a robust deep learning framework tailored for predictive analytics in customer behavior.

Comprehensive Data Preprocessing: Implements advanced techniques for imputing missing data, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing for improved model performance.

Rigorous Evaluation Metrics: Includes precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix analyses to provide a holistic assessment of model efficacy.

Requirements

The following dependencies are necessary for execution:

Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

These libraries facilitate seamless data manipulation, visualization, and model development.

Dataset

The dataset encompasses a rich set of features critical to churn analysis, including:

Demographic Attributes: Age, gender, and geographic information.

Account Characteristics: Tenure, account balance, and product usage statistics.

Behavioral Indicators: Estimated salary, credit score, and transaction patterns.

Target Variable: Binary indicator of churn status.

Before execution, ensure the dataset is appropriately formatted (e.g., CSV) and accessible within the designated directory.
